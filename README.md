## Data Collection Challenge Using HTML, Splinter, and BeautifulSoup

Submitted by: Lena Thongdara

In the initial phase of this assignment, Part 1 involved leveraging Splinter and BeautifulSoup for automated web browsing to access the Mars news website and extract HTML code. The task encompassed scraping titles and preview text from news articles, with the acquired information being diligently stored.

Advancing to Part 2 of the assignment, we once again harnessed the power of Splinter and BeautifulSoup, this time to extract an HTML table and transform it into a Pandas DataFrame. Subsequently, a series of analyses were conducted, accompanied by the creation of data visualizations aimed at delving deeper into the intricacies of Mars weather data.
